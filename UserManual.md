```

then run install.sh
``` bash
sh install.sh
```

to turn on the server
``` bash
sh start_server.sh
```

---

### continue for the installation
Because we want to make make the repository as clean as possible we decided to create the virtual environments out side the repository
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
After we created the virtual environments , we need to activated it <br>

#### for linux and mac user
```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```

#### for windows user
```bash
. venv/Scripts/activate
```

After we activated the environment we can go inside the repository
```bash
cd PROJECT
```

then update the pip and install the package
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that we need to go inside the server folder
```bash
cd Server
```

After we install the Django package, we need to do the migration to create the database for the server
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations api && python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
```

if you want to create a admin account you need to use "createsuperuser" and follow the instruction
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

After we setup the backend , we need to setup the frontend , so we go in to the frontend folder
```bash
cd frontend
```

then we install the package for the frontend 
```bash
npm i
```

then we build the frontend , otherwise django cannot handle it 
```bash
npm run build
```

After all the data and user was created we can start the server now , by using

```bash
python manage.py runserver 5000
```

then the server will run on local host port 3000

### Navigating the Application
Upon entering the application, users will be presented with three main pages: Home Page, VarDifferentMethod Page, and VaRWithOption Page. Use the Navbar located at the top of the application to switch between these pages.

#### Home Page
![](Document/images/Home%20page%20without%20data.png)
The Home Page displays 2 graphs, which include the returns and closing price charts, and a sidebar for user input related to stock VaR calculations.
Enter the following input:
- stock_list: AAPL,MSFT
- portfolio_weights: 0.5,0.5
- period: 501
- Time Horizon: 1
- Initial Investment: 10000
